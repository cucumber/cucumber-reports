# Terms & Privacy

Cucumber Reports is a free service provided for Cucumber's users by its core maintainers.

The source code for Cucumber Reports is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-reports) with the MIT license. The letter and spirit of that license extend to the service too: there's no warranty of any kind, express or implied, so your use of it is _entirely_ at your own risk. By using it, you're agreeing to the terms set out here.

Publishing is anonymous. No data is collected when you publish except the report content itself. The data is stored in data centers within the United States, and is encrypted at rest. The data is only ever accessed to serve the report content to users on this website or to delete it. We would, if necessary, also access the data to comply with a valid law enforcement request.

We use Google Analytics to track broad usage statistics on this website. No attempt is or will be made to identify individual users or link statistics to data from reports.

Any copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights pertaining to the content of a report remain yours. By publishing, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free but strictly-limited license for serving the content to users on this website, only until the report is deleted and for no other purpose.

Once published, reports are available at public URLs with no authentication. It's highly unlikely that anybody will guess the URL of your report, but you should assume it _could_ happen and act accordingly. Try to avoid having any of these make it into your reports:

- Commercially-sensitive intellectual property
- Personally-identifying information
- Credentials and other secrets

For clarity, the content of a report includes:

- Some metadata about the platform you're using
- The full content of your feature files
- Some of the code for your step definitions
- Attachments and logs from your tests
- Error messages and stack traces from your tests

You can see the full, raw content of what is published by using the "message" formatter when you run Cucumber and inspecting the output.

Reports are automatically deleted after 24 hours. This is a minimum retention period, not an exact cutoff â€” reports may be live for longer than 24 hours depending on scheduled data deletion. If you need a report to be gone for some reason, don't wait for it to expire, just use the "Delete" button.
