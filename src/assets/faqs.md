# Frequently-asked questions

## Can I restrict access to a report or keep it longer?

No, all reports are publicly accessible and are deleted after 24 hours.

## What happened to private reports and collections?

Private reports and collections were part of the previous incarnation of the service launched by SmartBear. Since then, the Cucumber project has [returned to community ownership](https://cucumber.io/blog/open-source/cucumber-is-back-in-community-ownership). Given our limited resources, when separating from SmartBear we chose not to take forward the private reports or collections and focused instead on offering an anonymous service to all users. If you have questions regarding the data you had in private reports, please contact SmartBear.

## Can I use this in my CI?

You can, and Cucumber will detect most common CI platforms so that your reports include links back to your Git commit and CI run. See [github.com/cucumber/ci-environment](https://github.com/cucumber/ci-environment) for what's supported and how you can contribute more.

## How can I report a bug or request a feature?

The code is open source, you can find the issues at [github.com/cucumber/cucumber-reports](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-reports/issues).
